# gingerOs-x86_64

Ginger Operating System (Ginger OS) is a simple OS intended to be fully POSIX-compliant and to some extent, though not fully, Linux compatible as much as possible.

Development of ginger Os started late in 2020 as a simple project for learning purposes and somewhere along the lines I found so much zeal and interest in OS-Dev and decided to go full blown and actually dedicate my time and resources into building something of my own. As of 2022, Ginger OS was still no where near being usable but the amount of knowledge I had gained along the way propelled me to my first ever useful, though small, intel x86 OS with a minimal shell and some basic programs like (with credit to UC's xv6 project), sh, cat, echo, grep, wc, pwd, etc. that you can find at the repo [gingerOS](http://github.com/Emment-Yamikani/gingerOs.git).
